API
*********

This document describes the API of the LGP system and includes high-level examples of how to use the system.

It is assumed that the reader has prior familiarity with LGP, or has read the section on :ref:`lgp-ref`.

The documentation of the API will not be extensive, as it is expected the `dokka API documentation <https://jeds6391.github.io/LGP/>`_ be used for that purpose.

This document should mainly serve as a reference for the overall concepts defined by the API.
