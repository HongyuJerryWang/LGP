Linear Genetic Programming
**************************

This document gives some context with respect to the core concepts of Linear Genetic Programming (LGP), and provides some description of how those concepts are expressed using the LGP API.

The concepts used in LGP as described here are given in Linear Genetic Programming (Brameier, M., Banzhaf, W. 2007).

As this is not expected to be a complete reference for LGP, further information should be found from the source text.
