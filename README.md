## About

An implementation of [Linear Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_genetic_programming) that follows that outlined by *Linear Genetic Programming* (Brameier, M. F. and Banzhaf, W. 2007).

The core API is implemented in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) which allows for easily interoperability with Java (and other JVM languages), while adding the benefit of modern programming language features.

To get started with how to use the system, see the [documentation](http://lgp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
